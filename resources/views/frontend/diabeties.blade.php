        <p class="text-gray-600">
            The number of people with diabetes rose from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. Prevalence has been
            rising more rapidly in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.
            Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation.
            <br>
            Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when
            the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose.
            Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled
            diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and
            blood vessels.
